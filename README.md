# quiz-form-generator: 



     This project focused on exploring the capabilities of advanced machine learning and deep learning models. In this specific project, our goal is to convert the responses generated by ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot model, into a quiz form.

    The main objective of the project is to develop a system that takes an audio prompt as input and utilizes the ChatGPT API to generate a conversational response. This response will be processed and transformed into a Google form quiz, making it more interactive and engaging for users.

    To accomplish this, we will leverage various technologies and APIs. The ChatGPT API will enable us to generate human-like responses based on the audio prompt, making the interaction feel more natural. We will also integrate the Google Forms API to programmatically create quizzes, allowing users to easily provide answers and submit their responses.

    Additionally, we will utilize the Speech-to-Text API to convert the audio prompt into text format, which can then be used as input for the ChatGPT model. By the end, we will create a user-friendly interface where users can record their audio prompts, and get the link to the google form generated.
